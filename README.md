#  Real-Time & Offline Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using pyannote.audio

This repository contains three Python-based implementations for performing Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio). Each implementation targets a different use case, from evaluating performance on the AMI dataset to real-time microphone input with live visualization.
